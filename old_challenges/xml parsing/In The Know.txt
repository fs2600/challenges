Staying In The Know
========================
SCENARIO:	You need to be up to snuff on and have some knowledge of the latest
			security vulnerabilities. Packetstormsecurity.org has the latest 20 vulnerabilties
			and releases listed in an xml/rss feed. You might as well grab all 20. Since you're 
			a clever young coder, you decide to automate the process rather than pint and click for 10
			minutes.

TASK:		Get the last 20 files released from packetstorm via its rss feed.

GIVEN:		http://packetstormsecurity.org/whatsnew20.xml -- The latest 20

POINTS:		10 Pts
			HINT - A more automated task is likely to be awarded higher points.
			Points will not be awarded on time of completion  nor the efficiency of code, 
			however, if a clever or novel solution is produced the judge may award bonus 
			points not to exceed 100% of challenge value.
