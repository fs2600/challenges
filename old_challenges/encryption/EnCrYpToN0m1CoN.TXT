=====================
SCENARIO:		You've encountered a tool that is being used to encrypt data on a system but can't seem to 
				find its man page. -h is no help, nor is google. You come to the conclusion that it must be
				some custom algorithm that was developed in house. Mr. j0hnnyW seems to be a clever lad...

TASK:			Reverse engineer the algorithm and develop a utility to decrypt files of data. 

GIVEN:			The binary ***tr.exe***
				sample_data.txt (it doesn't hurt to make your own either)
				HINT FROM SHYFT - If in a unix environment you will need to use wine.

POINTS:			35 Pts
				Points will not be awarded on time of completion nor the efficiency of code, 
				however, if a clever or novel solution is produced the judge may award bonus 
				points not to exceed 50% of challenge value.
				
				
	***NOTE***:
	Have no fear, THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MALICIOUS IN ANY WAY. This program was
	written by me(shyft), specifically for this challenge. No data is collected, nor can you be
	uniquely identified by using it.
